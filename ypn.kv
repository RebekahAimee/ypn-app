RootWidget:
# ^^^ This thing is important. Don't delete it.
# The classes defined in brackets are just classes. This widget here actually
# tells the interpreter to display the root widget, which starts off showing
# the Calendar page but can be cleared to display other stuff.
# If you delete it, you'll get a blank screen.
# If you replace it with the name of another widget, that one will display
# instead, which can be a useful debugging tool. Otherwise, don't touch!
# It's defined just below.

<RootWidget>:
    # inherits from BoxLayout; this widget has its own Python class.
    # It's useful to have a designated root widget because of
    # self.clear_widgets(), which clears all the /children/ of that widget,
    # and because app.root stores some important app-wide methods that are
    # easier to access this way.
    # There may be a simpler or better-encapsulated way to do these things,
    # and you're welcome to clean up if so, but just putting MenuPage as root
    # isn't it.
